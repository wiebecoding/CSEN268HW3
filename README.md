Book Club App

The Book Club App so far has a main page listing the books by Author by default (and by Title when the filter is selected). When a book is clicked a detail page is shown. The detail page has a back button letting the user go to the book list view

Todo

- Create a Book class with requisite fields
- Create a Cubit or a Bloc with your HomePage.
- Create a List of Books initially empty
- In the init() function of the Bloc/Cubit, fill in the books
- Create two widgets:
-   Displaying the book's image
-   Displaying the book's image, title, author, description
- Build the functionality for the transitions
-   Filtering (you have to sort the booklist by author or by title) (This will be the same view but you will manipulate list before rebuilding)
-   Remember! The Bloc/Cubit States are by default used with equatable. Therefore, if you emit the same state, it may not trigger a build. You may remove the Equatable or you may throw in a shimmer (waiting) while calculations are happening and then emit the same state, i.e. Book List View...
-   Showing the detail page
-   Add a leading Widget to the AppBar of the book detail page. Connect that leading Widget to a function in the cubit such that it emits a state where the list of books are visible
